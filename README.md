# it-depends

This is a repository for the visualization component of [it-depends](https://github.com/jyoo980/it-depends). This tool enables developers to more easily visualize dependencies between entities in a software system (classes, files, etc...) which cut across commit history.

## Version 2

v2 is still in development. This is re-write of the original visualization to try out a few things. Mainly, I felt the directed graphs of the v1 was too hard to read as the commit histories got larger. v2 uses a weighted tree structure instead, which should be cleaner. I also wanted to try out functional programming in JS & React.
